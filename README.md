# UPLiNK
Social network for Liberation in North Korea Organization

UPLiNK was a solo project made in about 24 hours in a hackathon to create a community site for the organization Liberty in North Korea.

For me personally, it was my first real attempt at making a site in Meteor.js, using Angular as a front-end framework instead of Handlebars. While it didn't win and not all of the planned features have been implemented yet (apparently a first-time Meteor developer can't actually outpace a team of 5 MEAN or PHP developers), I learned a lot more about Meteor (and Angular) while working on this.
