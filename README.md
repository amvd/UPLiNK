# UPLiNK
Social network for Liberation in North Korea Organization

UPLiNK was a solo project made in about 24 hours to create a community site for the organization Liberty in North Korea.
For me personally, it was my first real attempt at making a site in Meteor.js, using Angular as a front-end framework instead of Handlebars.
